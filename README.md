# Full Stack Azure Web App

A Full-Stack SQL Web App built with Razor Pages (ASP.NET) to perform C.R.U.D operations on an example SQL DB. The example SQL DB used is the "pubs" DB which is a sample SQL DB created by Microsoft with multiple tables of fictional authors, books, etc...

This project began life as a college lab, which I recently extended in my free time to use Azure for hosting a live SQL DB. Prior to this, the web app used a locally hosted SQL database instead.
