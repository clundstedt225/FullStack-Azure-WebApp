# Full Stack Azure Web App

A Full-Stack SQL Web App built with Razor Pages (ASP.NET) and Microsoft Azure as the backend hosting an SQL DB.

This project began life as a college lab, which I recently extended in my free time to use Azure for hosting a live SQL DB. Prior to this, the web app used a locally hosted SQL database instead.
